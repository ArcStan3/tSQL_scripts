A collection of scripts I find useful.

All code is provided freely to the reader. If you find any of these scripts useful, pay for a strangers coffee the next time your at a coffee shop. 

Many if not all of these scripts have origins from the fantastic community at stackoverflow  https://stackoverflow.com

Understand internet code before running it, espically if you see the words "drop", "truncate" or "exec"!
